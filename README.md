# homepage

A Hoplon project to implement the custom part of Exicon's public homepage.

## Dependencies

- [Java 1.8][1]
- [boot][2]

## Usage

1. Start the auto-compiler. In a terminal:

    ```bash
    $ cp config.example.sh config.sh
    $ source config.sh; boot dev
    ```

2. Go to [http://localhost:3103][3] in your browser.

Bootup takes around 60seconds *after* the dependencies are downloaded.
It's expected and will be improved, but the main reason for it is
this homepage is a multipage application, while Hoplon was primarily
meant to be used for creating Single Page Applications.

For production use we do precompilation which is part of the `prod` task.
The result will be in the `target/` directory, from where it can be served
with any webserver capable of serving static files.

    ```bash
    $ source config.sh; boot prod
    $ (cd target; python -mSimpleHTTPServer 3103)
    ```
