# homepage

A Hoplon project to implement the custom part of Exicon's public homepage.

## Dependencies

- Java 1.7+ in theory but in practice, on a Mac it needs [Java 1.8][1]
  otherwise it throws an out of memory error because of some bug
- [boot][2] for development
- [leiningen][3] for production compilation

## Usage

1. Start the auto-compiler. In a terminal:

    ```bash
    $ boot development
    ```

2. Go to [http://localhost:3003][4] in your browser.
