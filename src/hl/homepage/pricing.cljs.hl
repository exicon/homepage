	:question "Do I get all the features for free with the Starter Pack?"
	:answer [
		(p "We want to make sure that you get the best “taste” you can of the value that the
			AppBoard can bring you and your company. So we have added all of the features that
			don’t have to be customised for you for free. We have however limited the number of
			apps that you can try out with up to 5 (so those of you with 5 apps or less, your
				day just got even better!)")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "Do I need to give my credit card details when I sign up for the Starter pack?"
	:answer [
		(p "No, you just need to set up an account and you can start immediately.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "What is NOT included in the Starter Pack?"
	:answer [
		(p "The short answer is Competitor Insight (Challenger Pack), Automated Distribution
			(Distributor Pack) onto multiple stores and our API Portal (API Axle).")
		(p "You can get access to all of these features by upgrading to one of our other packs
			(Challenger - Competitor Insight; Dominator - Competitor Insight and Distribution
			onto multiple App Stores; Amplifier - customized solution Contact us).")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "How can I find out how many apps I have?"
	:answer [
		(p "When you first set up your AppBoard you will be asked to either securely connect your
			Google Play and iTunes account so that all of your apps are pulled straight to your AppBoard
			almost immediately, or you can add them manually. Every separate submission you make to an
			app store will be counted as 1 separate app. E.g. Acme iPad app + Acme iPhone app + Acme Android
			app = 3 apps in total.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "I have more than 5 apps. Can I still use the free Starter Pack?"
	:answer [
		(p "Yes, if you have more than 5 apps you will be asked to select which 5 apps you’d like to display
			in your AppBoard. If you have more than 5, be aware that you cannot change which apps you display later.
			We’d recommend that you use apps that you are just starting so that you can track them from end to end
			and keep on top of everything, and apps that you have as much data about as possible e.g. who in your
			team started the app, App Store analytics, who built it and in-app analytics if you have them (don’t worry
			if you don’t we can help you out). If you have more than 5 apps and want to display them all, move up to Challenger or Dominator Pack.")
		]
	}

{
	:question "Can I upgrade to the Challenger or Dominator pack after signing up for the Starter Pack?"
	:answer [
		(p "Yes. If (or should I say when) you decide that you want to add more apps or more features you can upgrade at
			any time. You can upgrade to the Challenger pack by going to “Competitor Insight” in your AppBoard where you will
			be given the choice to upgrade or to buy one-off reports. You can upgrade to the Dominator Pack by going to “Distribution”
			in your AppBoard where you will be given the choice to upgrade or to buy distribution for one-off a specific app.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "If I have signed up for the Challenger Pack can I add additional Competitor Insight on top of those I get as part of the subscription?"
	:answer [
		(p "Yes, you can buy as many Competitor Insights as you like on a one-off basis. You can buy Competitor Insight by going to “Competitor Insight”
			in your AppBoard where you will be given the choice to upgrade or to buy one-off reports.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "Can I use the Competitor Insight and enlarge my Distribution without upgrading to the Challenger or Dominator Pack?"
	:answer [
		(p "Yes, you can buy these features on a one off basis although it is more expensive per unit than upgrading. You can buy Competitive
			insights by going to 'Competitive Insights' in your AppBoard where you will be given the choice to upgrade or to buy one-off reports.
			You can buy the Distribution onto multiple appstores by going to “Distribution” in your AppBoard where you will be given the choice
			to upgrade or to buy distribution for a specific app.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "In the Challenger Pack, can I change my Competitor Insight parameters eg. country, industry, competitive brand?"
	:answer [
		(p "Yes, you can change this once every quarter.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "Can I spread my apps over different packages?"
	:answer [
		(p "The bundles were designed to match clear user types which is typically correlated to the number of apps you have.
			 Don't worry though, you can buy Competitor Insight + Distribution on a one-off basis no matter which package you signed up for.")
		]
	}

	{
	:question "I have more questions. Who do I ask?"
	:answer [
		(p "Contact us through the contact form " (a :href "/company/contact/" "here") " or call or send us an email. We’d be happy to chat with you.")
